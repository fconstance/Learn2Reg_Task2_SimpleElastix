# Learn2Reg_Task2_SimpleElastix

This code is made available in the context of the Learn2Reg 2020 challenge (https://learn2reg.grand-challenge.org/).
It corresponds to an Elastix-based [1] registration implementation for the second task. This task consists of intrasubject 3D HRCT inhale/exhale thorax images registration.

The corresponding dataset is publicaly available and downloadable: https://zenodo.org/record/3835682#.X4Vu5O06-Un.

### Requirements
